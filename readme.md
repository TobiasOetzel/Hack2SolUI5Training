This repository contains the steps of the official [UI5 walkthrough](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#docs/guide/3da5f4be63264db99f2e5b04c5e853db.html).
The links below help you getting started. I recommend using the WEB IDE. If you want to play around with the result of the walkthrough you can register for the ES4 system to add a real Gateway system to your application.

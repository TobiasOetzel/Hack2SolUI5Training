# Getting started with Grunt

Make sure you installed [git](http://git-scm.com/), [node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) and [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).

Then run in your command line

```shell
 npm install
 grunt server
```

The Configuration of your server is in the Gruntfile.js.
If you want you can add a basic authentication header to the ES4 service. Then you don't have to retype your password.
